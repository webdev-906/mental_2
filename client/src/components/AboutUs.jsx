Our Mission
</span>
</h2>
<p className="text-base text-ally6 md:text-lg">
We want to provide education and information to those seeking or receiving mental health services, such as people diagnosed with life-threatening/ terminal illnesses. We want to provide personal coping ability, and internal and external resources from their own areas of strength are often better able to address difficulties, feel more in control of the condition(s), and have a greater internal capacity to work toward mental and emotional well-being. Many Latino individuals who have a mental health condition know little or nothing about the condition they have been diagnosed with, (because itâ€™s such a taboo thing, and stigma) what they might expect from therapy or the positive and negative effects of any medications they may be prescribed.
